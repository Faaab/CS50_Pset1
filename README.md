# CS50_Pset1
This repository contains three small programs that I wrote for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science. All of them are written in C.
These programs have no connections to each other, and are here just for archiving purposes.

1. Hello.c
Prints "Hello, world!"

2. Mario ('more comfortable' edition)
Prints a shape made in spaces and hashes to the console.

3. Cash
This program accepts a floating-point value that represents an amount of change owed (in dollars) as input, and goves the minimum number of coins you would need for that amount of change as output.
